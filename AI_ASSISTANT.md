    "fullCode": "HTML content...",
    "selectedText": "Selected code...",
    "language": "html"
  }
}

// Expected response
{
  "response": "AI response text..."
}
```

- **Ollama**: Run models locally
- **LM Studio**: Local model interface
- **Custom APIs**: Your own AI infrastructure

## üéØ Best Practices

### **Getting Better Responses**
1. **Be Specific**: "Why isn't my flexbox centering?" vs "CSS not working"
2. **Provide Context**: Select relevant code before asking
3. **Ask Follow-ups**: "Can you show me an example?" "What about accessibility?"
4. **Use Quick Actions**: They provide good starting prompts

### **Code Quality**
1. **Regular Reviews**: Use "Debug Issues" periodically
2. **Learn from Suggestions**: Don't just copy, understand why
3. **Ask "Why"**: Understanding beats memorization
4. **Practice**: Use explanations to learn, then try without help
